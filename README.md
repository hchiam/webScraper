# webScraper.py
This is example web scraper code for searching for elements in a webpage.  How does it do it?  It looks for names or class names of html elements.  From there, you can get the text in that element, and you can see how it's then easy to use.
You can run this code from command-line (a.k.a. terminal in Mac) to see the things that the code finds.  Just download it, go down to the folder it's in, and run the command:  
python webScraper.py
